### Agary.com

Everybody knows [agar.io](http://agar.io/) and many people play the game, because its a great game. But
the game requires a lot of patience before the real action happens, and you can start eating others. It
is almost impossible to beat someone twice as big as you. The main issue is the merge time of the cells.

Well, this is where [agary.com](http://agarly.com) jumps in, its a variant of agar.io in which the merge
time is zero. Which results in an active game right from the start. It is now possible to beat 
someone ten times times or even bigger then you are. 

But, even though they solved the biggest problem which I had with agar.io, there can be done more to
improve the game experience and make it a very challenging game.

  1. Repeat shooting when holding the key down. 
Together with the second improvement, these are the best. You can shoot extremely fast which gives
you many advantages. Here I will only name one, so you have to find the others yourself :) 
And it is that you can merge extremely fast and helps you to beat someone a lot bigger than you are. This
definitely add a lot to the fun you will have with this game.

  2. Shoot with all alphabetic keys  
Sometimes you have to handle very quickly or else someone will eat you. Now, for example, to merge faster
you should use shooting. This can only be done with the `w` key. I lost so many times because I pressed
 the `q` or `e` so it turns out that it works a lot better if all alphabetic keys can shoot.

  3. Repeat splitting when holding the space-bar down   
To move faster you need to split many times, so it just make sense to repeat splitting if the space-bar 
is pressed down.

  4. Limit splitting with the `command` key  
I consider this one as a bit of a game spoiler, because it enables you to catch someone who is on the run
for you. But because others are using it, I've decided to add this feature. If you press and hold down
the `command` key it will behave identical to the space-bar except that it will only split 4 times. The
advantage of this is that when you chase someone, you don't have to worry to much that you will split to 
many times and get to small cells.

  5. Prevent the new tab with spam  
I always get just in the middle of some fight a new tab with spam. And this new tab has dialogs so it
takes some time to close it, and when you do, you might already lost the fight you were in. So, I made
sure that this is not happening anymore.


### Setup
This hack has only be tested with Chrome. First go to [agarly.com](http://agarly.com). Now, when the 
page is loaded open the console (alt + cammand + j) and past the hack into the console. You can use 
the normal or minified version.

### Rooms
There are a couple of rooms which are picked randomly if you go to [agarly.com](http://agarly.com). Some 
rooms are busy and others are not. So if you end up in a room with only bots, hit refresh until you see
and active room.


### VERY IMPORTANT
If you see a cell with the name `teAm eXtreMe++` it most likely will be me - please don't eat me!!!

You can find me in this room: [http://agarly.com/k2ByX](http://agarly.com/k2ByX)
